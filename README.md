# Gold Recovery Process

## 1. Description
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores. The great majority of gold is extracted from dilute ores using a combination of chemical processes. A "refractory" gold ore is an ore that has ultra-fine gold particles disseminated throughout its gold occluded minerals. They are naturally resistant to recovery by standard cyanidation and carbon adsorption processes. These refractory ores require pre-treatment in order for cyanidation to be effective in recovery of the gold. The refractory ore treatment processes may be preceded by concentration (usually sulphide flotation). Roasting is used to oxidize both the sulphur and organic carbon at high temperatures using air and/or oxygen. Then pressure oxidation is applied for sulphur removal carried out in a continuous autoclave, operating at high pressures and somewhat elevated temperatures.

## 4. Rersults
Technological process of gold recovery is studied in detail. Recovery rate is calculated and assessed by sMAPE metric which shows the high accuracy of predictions and low percentage error. The best models are Bagging Regressor and Gradient Boosting with results just below 9 (8.68 and 8.89 respectively).
